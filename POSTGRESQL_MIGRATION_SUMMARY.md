# PostgreSQL Migration Summary

## What was done:

1. **Database Configuration**:
   - Updated the DATABASE_URL in [backend/.env](file:///d:/Qoder/cafe-d-revenue-main/backend/.env) to use PostgreSQL with your credentials
   - Added `psycopg2-binary` to [backend/requirements.txt](file:///d:/Qoder/cafe-d-revenue-main/backend/requirements.txt) for PostgreSQL support
   - Verified that the application configuration properly reads the DATABASE_URL

2. **Database Setup**:
   - Created the `cafedrev` database in PostgreSQL using the [setup_postgres.py](file:///d:/Qoder/cafe-d-revenue-main/setup_postgres.py) script
   - Verified that the database was created successfully

3. **Data Migration**:
   - Migrated all data from SQLite to PostgreSQL using the [migrate_to_postgres.py](file:///d:/Qoder/cafe-d-revenue-main/migrate_to_postgres.py) script
   - Successfully migrated:
     - 75 customers (with zero balance as requested)
     - 3 users (including the admin user)
     - 1 recharge transaction
     - All other related data (categories, products, sales, etc.)

4. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Fixed port configuration in [backend/start_backend.py](file:///d:/Qoder/cafe-d-revenue-main/backend/start_backend.py) to use port 9000 as requested
   - Updated proxy configuration in [vite.config.ts](file:///d:/Qoder/cafe-d-revenue-main/vite.config.ts) to point to the correct backend port

5. **Verification**:
   - Verified database connection is working properly
   - Confirmed data was migrated correctly with a test script
   - Updated README.md with PostgreSQL setup instructions

## How to run the application:

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```
   cd backend
   python start_backend.py
   ```
   The backend will be available at http://127.0.0.1:9000

2. **Start the frontend application** (in a new terminal):
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3010

## Notes:

- The application is now using PostgreSQL as the database
- All your customer data has been migrated with zero balance as requested
- The admin user is available with username `admin` and password `admin123`
- Remember to change the admin password after first login for security reasons
